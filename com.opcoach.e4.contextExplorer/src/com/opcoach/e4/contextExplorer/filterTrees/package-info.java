/**
 *  This package is a copy of the FilteredTree of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs got from org.eclipse.ui.workbench plugin.
 *  And also of String Matcher from package org.eclipse.ui.internal.misc;
 *  It has been copied to avoid a strong dependency to E3, while the context Explorer is a pure E4 component.
 *  It will be rebound to the correct classes when they will be available.
